# FYBCA Notes Repository

This folder contains notes for all subjects in the FYBCA (First Year of Bachelor of Computer Applications) course.  Each subject's notes are organized within its own subfolder.

*   **Subject Folders:** Each subject has its own dedicated folder (e.g., "Database Management System", "Programming in C","Basic of Web Technology").  The folder name clearly indicates the subject.

## How to Use These Notes

You can also use online Markdown viewers.
